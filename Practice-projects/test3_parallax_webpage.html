            Thankyou for showing interest, here is a quick story of me and this website. My programming
            journey started back in 2021,when  I started studying CSE in Chitkara university.
            I am currently in my third year and doing Technical Content Writing Internship
            at GeeksForGeeks. I like coding all kind of problems from the very basic like adding
            numbers to the complex ones like competitive programming problems. I love making projects and games.
            Infact this website is one of my Web Development Projects which is built using HTML and CSS.<br> <br>
            Languages known : C Language, C++, JAVA, Python, JavaScript, MySQL.<br> IT Constructs : Data
            Structures and Algorithm, OOP, HTML, CSS, LINUX, and Git & GitHub.
